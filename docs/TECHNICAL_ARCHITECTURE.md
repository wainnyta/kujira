### Function Calling Implementation

The system leverages DeepSeek's function calling capabilities to ensure structured and reliable AI responses. Rather than relying on free-form text parsing, function calling provides a robust mechanism for extracting specific trading recommendations with defined parameters and confidence levels.

```python
def _get_trading_functions(self) -> Dict:
    return {
        "name": "generate_trading_signal",
        "description": "Generate a trading signal based on market analysis",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "recommendation": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "enum": ["BUY", "SELL", "HOLD"],
                    "description": "Trading recommendation"
                },
                "confidence": {
                    "type": "number",
                    "minimum": 0,
                    "maximum": 100,
                    "description": "Confidence score for the recommendation"
                },
                "entry_price": {
                    "type": "number",
                    "description": "Recommended entry price"
                },
                "stop_loss": {
                    "type": "number",
                    "description": "Stop loss price"
                },
                "reasoning": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Detailed reasoning for the recommendation"
                }
            },
            "required": ["recommendation", "confidence", "reasoning"]
        }
    }
```

### Cost Optimization Strategies

The AI integration implements several cost optimization strategies to minimize API expenses while maintaining analysis quality. Context caching reduces redundant API calls by storing and reusing common market data and analysis contexts. The system implements intelligent batching of analysis requests to maximize the value of each API call.

Rate limiting and request queuing ensure that API usage stays within cost-effective bounds while preventing service disruptions due to rate limit violations. The system monitors token usage and costs in real-time, providing administrators with detailed cost tracking and budget management capabilities.

### Model Selection and Fallback

The architecture supports multiple AI models with intelligent fallback mechanisms. The primary model (deepseek-chat) handles standard market analysis tasks, while more complex scenarios can escalate to advanced models (deepseek-reasoner) when additional analytical depth is required.

Model selection is based on analysis complexity, account size, and cost considerations. Smaller accounts default to cost-optimized models, while larger accounts can access more sophisticated analysis capabilities. This tiered approach ensures that AI costs remain proportional to account size and trading frequency.

        self.max_calls = max_calls
        self.time_window = time_window
        self.calls = []
    
    def __call__(self, func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            now = time.time()
            self.calls = [call_time for call_time in self.calls 
                         if now - call_time < self.time_window]
            
            if len(self.calls) >= self.max_calls:
                sleep_time = self.time_window - (now - self.calls[0])
                if sleep_time > 0:
                    time.sleep(sleep_time)
            
            self.calls.append(now)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
```

## Risk Management System

### Position Sizing Algorithm

The risk management system implements sophisticated position sizing algorithms designed to protect capital while maximizing growth potential. The core algorithm calculates position sizes based on account balance, risk percentage per trade, and the distance to stop-loss levels.

The position sizing calculation follows the formula: Position Size = (Account Balance × Risk Percentage) ÷ (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price). This ensures that each trade risks only the predetermined percentage of account capital, regardless of the specific asset or market conditions.

### Stop-Loss Management

Automated stop-loss management is a critical component of the risk management system. The system enforces mandatory stop-loss orders for all positions, with default stop-loss levels set at 2% below entry prices for long positions. Stop-loss levels can be adjusted based on market volatility and asset characteristics.

The system implements trailing stop-loss functionality for profitable positions, automatically adjusting stop-loss levels as positions move favorably. This mechanism locks in profits while allowing positions to continue benefiting from favorable price movements.

### Portfolio-Level Risk Controls

Beyond individual position risk management, the system implements portfolio-level risk controls to prevent excessive concentration and correlation risks. Maximum position limits prevent over-concentration in any single asset, while correlation analysis helps avoid multiple positions in highly correlated assets.

Daily loss limits provide an additional safety mechanism, automatically halting trading activities if daily losses exceed predetermined thresholds. This prevents emotional decision-making during adverse market conditions and preserves capital for future opportunities.

### Risk Event Logging

The risk management system maintains comprehensive logs of all risk events, including position size calculations, stop-loss adjustments, and risk limit violations. This logging provides valuable data for system optimization and regulatory compliance.

```python
class RiskEvent(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    account_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('account.id'))
    event_type = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    severity = db.Column(db.String(20), default='info')
    description = db.Column(db.Text)
    data = db.Column(db.Text)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
```

### Strategy Simulation Engine

The strategy simulation engine provides realistic trading environment simulation, including accurate fee calculations, slippage modeling, and order execution delays. The engine processes historical data chronologically, generating trading signals and executing simulated trades based on the same logic used in live trading.

```python
def _execute_backtest_trade(self, signal: Dict, timestamp: datetime, 
                          price: float, balance: float, positions: Dict, 
                          config: Dict) -> Optional[Dict]:
    risk_amount = balance * (config['risk_percentage'] / 100)
    stop_loss = signal.get('stop_loss', price * 0.98)
    price_risk = abs(price - stop_loss)
    
    if price_risk <= 0:
        return None
    
    quantity = risk_amount / price_risk
    position_value = quantity * price
    commission = position_value * config['commission_rate']
    
    # Execute trade simulation
    return self._process_simulated_trade(signal, quantity, price, commission)
```

### Performance Metrics Calculation

The backtesting framework calculates a comprehensive suite of performance metrics essential for strategy evaluation. These metrics include total return, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, win rate, profit factor, and various risk-adjusted return measures.

Metric calculations follow industry-standard methodologies to ensure compatibility with professional trading analysis tools. The system provides both absolute and risk-adjusted performance measures to enable comprehensive strategy comparison and optimization.

### Visualization and Reporting

The backtesting framework generates professional-quality reports including equity curves, drawdown charts, trade distribution analysis, and monthly performance breakdowns. These visualizations are created using matplotlib and seaborn libraries, ensuring high-quality output suitable for professional presentation.

```python
def _plot_equity_curve(self, result: BacktestResult, output_dir: str):
    fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(12, 10))
    
    timestamps = [eq['timestamp'] for eq in result.equity_curve]
    portfolio_values = [eq['portfolio_value'] for eq in result.equity_curve]
    
    ax1.plot(timestamps, portfolio_values, color=self.colors[0], 
             linewidth=2, label='Portfolio Value')
    ax1.set_title('Portfolio Equity Curve', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
    ax1.set_ylabel('Portfolio Value ($)')
    ax1.legend()
    ax1.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
```
